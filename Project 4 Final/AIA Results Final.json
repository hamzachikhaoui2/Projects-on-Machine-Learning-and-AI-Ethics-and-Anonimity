The main objective of this classifier is to help medical professionals to decide whether patients should be prioritized in terms of the care they receive or not.\n\nNurses and doctors can in turn use the classifier to see whether a new patient at the ER is likely to have a heart disease or not, and use this information to make informed decisions on the treatment of the patient. Indeed, if the algorithm classifies someone as having a heart disease, then the ER can take more time with their diagnosis and treatment decision. If not, they can speed up the process.","businessDrivers1":["item2","item5","item1","item3"],"businessDrivers3":"The clients needs that the system address are the following:\n-  The need to receive appropriate care when getting to the ER depending or whether or not they have a heart disease.\n-  The need to be receiving care as fast as possible, as the algorithm greatly speeds up the triaging process at the hospital.\n- The need to be receiving quality care, as more time would be spent by the healthcare practitioners actually healing the patients rather than undertaking logistics tasks","businessDrivers4":"The public benefits of the system would be that they can alleviate some critical pressure on hospitals by improving the flow of patient management , allow for a faster and more tailored care of the patients, and improve the experience of patients when receiving urgent care.","businessDrivers5":"item3-0","businessDrivers6":"The following improvements are to be noted through our use of an automated system:\n- A more systematic and more reliable triaging system.\n- A faster triaging system that human triaging.\n- Allowing more patients to be taken care of through prioritizing the patients  require more urgent care \n","businessDrivers7":"The system is confined to addressing the clients needs as the application comports only the classifier as a core module. The algorithm's sole purpose is to accurately classify the patients that are prone to having a heart disease. Furthermore, the algorithm is to be used under the supervision of a health practitioner that will oversee the triaging process.","businessDrivers8":"There is a tradeoff between every patient wanting to receiving urgent care when getting at the ER, and the need for our model (and hospitals) to prioritize that patients that are prone to having a heart disease.","businessDrivers9":"item2-1","businessDrivers11":["item3-0","item4-0","item2-2"],"riskProfile1":"item1-3","riskProfile2":"item1-3","riskProfile3":"item1-4","riskProfile4":"item1-3","riskProfile5":"item2-0","projectAuthority1":"item2-0","aboutSystem1":["item3","item4"],"aboutAlgorithm1":"item1-3","aboutAlgorithm2":"item2-0","decisionSector3":"The decision that will be automated is the decision of whether or not a patient should receive urgent care at the ER.

However, the final decision of whether or not the patient will receive urgent care at the ER will be made by the health practitionner.","impact3":"item2-0","impact20":"The algorithm will use a machine learning model to classify whether or not the patient is at risk of a heart disease.    ","impact21":"The output of the machine learning algorithm is the positive prediction (1) or not (0) of a heart disease in a patient according to a series of features. No other information is needed to interpret the results of the algorithm","impact22":"item2-0","impact5":"item1-4","impact6":"item1-1","impact7":"item2-2","impact8":"We can start off by saying that the impacts from the decision are reversible as the health practitioners can at any moment change their decisions and provide a patient with urgent care. \n\nMoreover, the timing of the impacts of the decision are to be analyzed on a case by case basis, as a wrong decision from the algorithm can have immediate impacts that are unrelated to the algorithm (for example the state of a patient can deteriorate and require urgent care that would be unrelated a heart disease, or the algorithm). On the other hand, correct decisions made by the algorithm can potentially save a patient's life, but do not constitute a guarantee of him being well in the coming months or years.\n\nTherefore, the timeline of the impacts is the product of other events and cannot be solely quantified as a result of the correct/incorrect decision made by the algorithm.","impact9":"item1-1","impact10":"The freedoms of individuals are not affected by the algorithm, as our model does not have any consequence on the freedom of patients to access healthcare. Moreover, the patient can decide at any point to opt-out and receive care from different practitioners. \n\nOne could nuance this statement. The output of the algorithm does not constitute a barrier to access healthcare services for the patient per say. However, the algorithm may affect the speed at which the patient receives care (whether faster or \"slower\") which in situations of urgency may be critical.","impact24":"item1-1","impact25":"There is inherent bias in any algorithm that would be based on existing data. However, we have put in place a series of measures to limit the bias of our algorithm with regards to the different populations represented in our dataset. \nWe have also put in place privacy measures to ensure that protecting the privacy of the patients is at the core of our model","impact11":"item3-3","impact12":"A correct decision from the algorithm can have as a consequence to save the life of a patient. On the other hand, a wrong decision made by the algorithm (not detecting a heart disease for example) may in turn cause dramatic consequences for the patient. \nBecause this technology is designed to be implemented in hospitals, the hopefully positive impacts of the algorithm will have a direct impact on the health and well-being of the patients, by allowing health practitioners to have more time to provide critical care to the patients.","impact13":"item1-1","impact14":"Because our model is to be implemented under the direct supervision of healthcare practitioners, one can hardly see how the model will replace some health practitioners' jobs or cause layoffs from the hospital.\nMoreover, there will be no additional direct impact on the economic interests of individuals other than the ones that already exist in a hospital setting","impact15":"item1-1","impact16":"One can say that there is only little to no added energy consumption required to run our model. Moreover, one could argue that whatever little energy is used to implement the algorithm is widely counterbalanced by the savings made as a result of a better ressource allocation within the hospital.","aboutDataSource1":"item1-4","aboutDataSource9":"item1-0","aboutDataSource10":"item1-2","aboutDataSource11":"item2-1","aboutDataSource2":"item2-1","aboutDataSource3":"item3-2","aboutDataSource4":"item1-4","aboutDataSource5":"item2-0","aboutDataSource6":"item2-0","aboutDataSource7":"item4-4","aboutDataSource8":"item1-1","aboutDataSource13":"Health practitioners at the hospital where the system will be deployed will collect the input data from the patients for classification","aboutDataType1":"item2","consultationImplementation1":"item1-1","consultationImplementation2":["item9"],"consultationImplementation3":"item1-1","consultationImplementation2-other":"We are engaged with the hospitals that will use our product, who themselves are subject to compliance on standards from healthcare governing entities on the provincial and federal level","consultationImplementation4":["item2","item7"],"dataQualityImplementation1":"item1-2","dataQualityImplementation2":"item1-1","dataQualityImplementation3":"item1-1","dataQualityImplementation4":"item1-1","dataQualityImplementation5":"item1-1","dataQualityImplementation6":"item1-1","dataQualityImplementation7":"item1-2","dataQualityImplementation8":"item1-2","dataQualityImplementation9":"item1-1","dataQualityImplementation10":"item2-0","fairnessImplementation1":"item1-1","fairnessImplementation2":"item1-2","fairnessImplementation3":"item1-2","fairnessImplementation4":"item1-1","fairnessImplementation5":"item1-2","fairnessImplementation6":"item1-1","fairnessImplementation7":"item2-0","fairnessImplementation8":"item1-2","fairnessImplementation9":"item1-1","fairnessImplementation10":"item2-0","fairnessImplementation11":"item1-1","fairnessImplementation12":"item1-1","fairnessImplementation13":"item1-2","fairnessImplementation14":"item1-2","fairnessImplementation15":"item1-1","fairnessImplementation16":"item1-2","fairnessImplementation17":"item1-1","privacyImplementation1":"item2-0","privacyImplementation6":"- We have implemented k anonymous and l diverse datasets. \n- We have implemented differentially private models ","privacyImplementation2":"item1-1","privacyImplementation3":"item1-1","privacyImplementation4":"item1-1","privacyImplementation7":"item1-1","privacyImplementation8":"k anonimity, l diversity, differentially private models"},"translationsOnResult":{}}
