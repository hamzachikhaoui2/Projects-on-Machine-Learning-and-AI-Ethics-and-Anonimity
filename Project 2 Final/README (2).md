- matplotlib version: 3.7.1
- torch version: 2.1.0+cu121
- Python version: 3.10.12 (main, Nov 20 2023, 15:14:05) [GCC 11.4.0]



pip installable commands :

The submission is composed of the following documents: 
- the juptyer notebook with the printed results avilable:
    - **Note : The only place where the directories of the datasets would have to be modified is in the set-up section of the notebook, in the 4th and last cell of the section**. The datasets used to generate the models will also be submitted alongside the notebook.
    - The jupyter notebook contains the following sections : 
        - Set up
        - Part 2 : the code for generating the k-anonimity tables
        - Part 3 : 
            - Question 4 (non-private model)
            - Question 5 (differentially private model)
            - Question 7 (plot of accuracy vs epsilon)
            - Question 8 (performance of differentially private model with epsilon = 5)

- The report (pdf document) named "Final submission Assignment 2 ECSE 557"
- The excel file where all the k-anonymity tables generated during this assignment are available.
- This read me file.
