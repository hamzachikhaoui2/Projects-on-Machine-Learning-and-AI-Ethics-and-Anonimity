# README

## Introduction

One purpose of this code is to perform data preprocessing, scaling, and visualization using popular libraries such as NumPy, Matplotlib, Pandas, Seaborn, and scikit-learn.
 
The other purpose is to create a binary classifier, and perform an analysis of the model using multiple metrics.

## Important note
**The file path to the dataset has to be updated for the code to run. The only cell where this has to be done is the second cell of the "Setup" section.**


## Code Overview

The code in this repository is structured to perform the following tasks:


1. **Part 2.0 : Setup:** Using Pandas for loading and manipulating datasets, **and enter the file path to the dataset**.

2. **Part 2.1 : Data Preprocessing:** Analyzing the dataset as given, and pre-processing it so that it could be fed to a binary classifier model.

3. **Part 2.2 : Developping the model:** Building the binary classifier and assessing its performance using multiple criteria. Moreover, multiple models have been implemented to ensure a generalizable assessment.
